# Zombie Run
### Side scrolling 2D platformer built with javascript canvas.
First game I ever built so it's rather buggy and slow and unlikely to be fixed!
Mobile controls use a javascript library from [this github user](https://github.com/qbolec/Joydiv) which I modified slightly and have included in this repo as `joydiv.js` for convenience.
